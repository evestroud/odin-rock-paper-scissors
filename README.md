# odin-rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors project for Project Odin

Currently runs only using browser prompts. Have to call the function 'game' in the console to start it. Win status is output to the #output element but the buttons on the page are inactive. This fulfills the basic requirements of the assignment but I want to come back and connect the buttons and text objects to make a responsive webpage to play the game with.
